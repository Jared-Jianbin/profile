            <h3>Responsible</h3>
            <p>
              Being responsible at work is curcial, and you can rely on me. I
              always finish my tasks on time, and deliver as good as possible
              result. The best record in my career life is ZERO late-to-work in
              two sequential years.

            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
            <p>
              As a member in a group, I am aware of that we are dependent on
              each other, we work as a team, we grow as a team. We trust,
              support, and encourage each other to make a greater success. I am
              always open for communication, and this is how I learn from my
              team.

            <h3>Detail Oriented</h3>
            <p>
              One subtle bug in the codes could cost a company millions dollar.
              At all stages of developing an application, I pay 100% attention
              to the codes and take all edge cases into consideration. To
              eliminate potential bugs, I have a habit of checking back my codes
              at a reasonable frequency, and make sure everything works well at
              the moment.

            <p>
              New technologies are released frequently, and I will dedicate
              myself to keep up the pace in current industry. I am able to learn
              new stuffs quickly and put it into real case use.

              I love all kinds of food, especially sushi. If you love food too,
              we wll be good friends. Except that I'm not much into spicy food,
              but life needs inspiration, and spiciness works out perfectly
              fine.

            <p>
              I love making friends. I consider myself a tolerant and
              magnanimous person. Might seem a little be shy at the beginning,
              but will certainly be "not shy" when we know each other well.
